            </h1>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">a) Terms of Grant</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
    You must read the standard terms of grant for this programme on our website.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    By completing this Declaration, you are confirming that your organisation accepts these terms. For partnership projects, all partners must confirm that they accept the <a href="https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/publications/standard-terms-grants-3k-10k">standard terms of grant</a> by adding a contact at the end of the declaration.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">b) Freedom of Information and Data Protection</h2> 

<p class="govuk-body">
    We are committed to being as open as possible. This includes being clear about how we assess and make decisions on our grants and how we will use your application form and other documents you give us. As a public organisation we have to follow all data protection laws and regulations, to include European Parliament directives and regulations that are applicable and in force from time to time (the 'Data Protection legislation'). As defined by the Data Protection legislation the Trustees of the National Heritage Memorial Fund (who administer the National Lottery Heritage Fund) is a data controller.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    As part of the application process we will collect your name and position at the organisation you represent. We may share this information with one of the consultants on our Register of Support Services if they are appointed to help support you on your project. We do not transfer your data to any third parties based outside of the EU. Our Privacy Policy contains additional information including contact information for our Data Protection Officer. It can be found on the National Lottery Heritage Fund website.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    When you complete the Declaration at the end of the application form, you are confirming that you understand our legal responsibilities under data protection legislation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and have no objection to us releasing the About your project and Support for your project sections of the application form to anyone who asks to see them once your application has completed the assessment process. If there is any information in these sections of the form that you don't want made publicly available, please explain your reasons below:

}) }}

<p class="govuk-body">
    We will take these into account when we respond to any request for access to those sections. We may also be asked to release other information that you provide to us. We will respond to these requests after taking account of your rights and expectations under Data Protection legislation. In those cases, we will always consult you first. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage you suffer as a result of our meeting these responsibilities.
